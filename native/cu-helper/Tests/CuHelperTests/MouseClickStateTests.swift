/// Regression cover for the field that decides whether a synthesized pointer
/// event counts as part of a click.
///
/// Background: the leading move of a coordinate click used to carry the repeat
/// count (1 for a single click, 2 for a double) instead of 0, so the target was
/// told "a pointer belonging to click N arrived" before any button went down.
/// Measured against an Electron target, single clicks then registered as hover
/// and never activated the control, while double clicks worked — the second
/// press/release pair got through. Nothing in the suite covered these fields,
/// which is why the value survived from the engine's first commit.
