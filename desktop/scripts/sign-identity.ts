/**
 * Shared code-signing identity resolution for the macOS build.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The native Computer Use helper refuses commands unless its caller chain is
 * cryptographically the desktop app: `ClientAttestation.swift` requires the
 * host (the Electron app, whose identifier is `build.appId` in
 * `desktop/package.json`), the sidecar
 * (`com.claude-code-haha.desktop.sidecar`) and the helper
 * (`dev.cchaha.cu-helper`) to share one signing certificate — same leaf, and
 * the same Team ID when the certificate has one. If any link is ad-hoc or
 * signed by a different cert, every helper call returns `unauthorized_client`
 * and Computer Use is dead in the water.
 *
 * Three separate build steps produce those three binaries (electron-builder,
 * `build-sidecars.ts`, `native/cu-helper/build.sh`), so they need one shared
 * answer to "which certificate?". That answer lives here.
 *
 * Preference order — Developer ID FIRST, deliberately:
 *   1. `CC_HAHA_SIGN_IDENTITY` — explicit override, trusted verbatim.
 *   2. `Developer ID Application: …` — long-lived, notarizable, distributable.
 *      TCC grants are keyed to the signing identity, so a cert that does not
 *      expire yearly is what keeps the user's Accessibility + Screen Recording
 *      grants alive across rebuilds.
 *   3. `Apple Development: …` — works, but expires in about a year, and the
 *      replacement cert silently invalidates every TCC grant.
 *   4. the local self-signed development certificate (`cu-helper-dev`) — no
 *      Apple account required. It is self-signed, so it has no Team ID, but it
 *      is stable across rebuilds, which is all the helper's attestation needs
 *      as long as host, sidecar and helper all carry it.
 *   5. none → caller decides (ad-hoc for local unsigned builds).
 *
 * `native/cu-helper/build.sh` mirrors this order in shell; keep the two in sync.
