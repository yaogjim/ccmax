/**
 * Shared vocabulary for the unified workspace.
 *
 * Three layers own three different things and must not be conflated:
 *
 * 1. **Layout / navigation** — which panel is visible, where a tab sits, which
 *    tab is active. Owned by `workspaceStore`.
 * 2. **Content data** — file bytes, review diffs, tree expansion. Owned by the
 *    per-kind content stores.
 * 3. **Running resources** — `webContents`, PTYs, watchers. Owned by the host
 *    services and keyed by the *resource* id below, never by the UI tab id.
 *
 * The separation is the whole point: a UI tab id is a navigation handle that a
 * React unmount may outlive, while `browserTabId` / `runtimeId` name a live
 * process. Reusing one for the other is how the previous implementation ended
 * up destroying a page whenever the panel switched modes.
