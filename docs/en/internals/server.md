# Local Server and API

The local server is the runtime boundary between Desktop, the H5 browser client, and the Claude CLI. It provides REST APIs, the chat WebSocket, provider protocol translation, and Desktop web assets. The packaged Desktop app manages it automatically. Start it manually only for source development, headless deployment, or a custom client.

## Start the server

From the repository root:

```bash
bun run src/server/index.ts
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:3456` by default. Check readiness with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3456/health
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`/health` is an always-public startup probe. A successful response does not prove that another endpoint is authenticated.

## Startup options

| Option | Environment variable | Default | Description |
|--------|----------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--host <host>` | `SERVER_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Listen address |
| `--port <port>` | `SERVER_PORT` | `3456` | HTTP and WebSocket port |
| `--cli-path <path>` | `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` | Automatically resolved | CLI started by the server |
| `--auth-required` | `SERVER_AUTH_REQUIRED=1` | Off | Require explicit authentication for capability endpoints |

Command-line host and port values take precedence over environment variables. Keep the loopback address for development. Listening on `0.0.0.0` accepts external connections but does not configure H5 authorization, TLS, or a reverse proxy.

## Serve the H5 client

For a source launch, build the Desktop web assets first:

```bash
cd desktop
bun run build
cd ..
bun run src/server/index.ts
```

The server automatically finds `desktop/dist` in the repository. When starting from another directory, provide the absolute build path:

```bash
CLAUDE_H5_DIST_DIR=/absolute/path/to/desktop/dist \
  bun run /absolute/path/to/src/server/index.ts
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_H5_DIST_DIR` | H5 build directory; it must contain `index.html` |
| `CLAUDE_H5_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Fixed public server URL |
| `CLAUDE_H5_AUTO_PUBLIC_URL=1` | Try to derive a LAN URL while H5 access is enabled |

Configure the H5 token and exact allowed browser origins in **Settings → H5 Access**. Treat the token like an API key and regenerate it to revoke existing browser access.

## Access control

The server classifies the source of each request before granting access to a capability path:

| Request | Default behavior |
|---------|------------------|
| `GET /health` | Public startup probe |
| H5 shell and static assets | Public bootstrap content; they do not contain session data |
| Direct loopback request | Trusted only when client address, Host, and Origin are local and no proxy-trace header is present |
| Remote capability request while H5 is disabled | Denied for `/api`, `/proxy`, `/ws`, and file capabilities |
| Remote capability request while H5 is enabled | Requires a valid H5 token and an allowed browser Origin |
| `--auth-required` / `SERVER_AUTH_REQUIRED=1` | Requires explicit authentication for capability endpoints even when H5 is disabled |

A TCP peer address of `127.0.0.1` does not prove that the end user is local. A reverse proxy must preserve the public `Host` or send at least one of `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-*`, `X-Real-IP`, or `Via`, allowing the server to distinguish proxied traffic from direct loopback traffic.

### Passing tokens

- REST, provider proxy, and file endpoints: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Browser WebSocket: `/ws/<session-id>?token=<token>`

H5 mode uses the token generated in Settings. Explicit `--auth-required` mode can also accept a bearer token equal to the server's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, but exposing a model credential for remote access is discouraged. Prefer H5 with its separate token.

CORS restricts browser access to responses; it is not authentication. It does not make a non-browser client safe.

## HTTP API surface

Business REST APIs live under `/api/*` and cover:

- sessions, conversations, search, and filesystem access;
- settings, permissions, models, effort, and providers;
- agents, tasks, teams, and scheduled tasks;
- skills, plugins, the market, and MCP;
- IM adapters and Computer Use;
- diagnostics, Doctor, activity statistics, memory, and traces;
- H5 access control.

For exact request and response shapes, use the current handlers under `src/server/api/`. The internal `/sdk/<session-id>` WebSocket is used by the Claude CLI process started by the server; it is not a third-party client API.

`/proxy/*` is the provider protocol-translation boundary and depends on runtime authentication and model-routing state. Do not expose it as a general-purpose stateless OpenAI proxy.

## Public authorization for scheduled-task notifications

`TaskNotificationConfig.telegramEntrypoints` in `src/server/services/cronService.ts` is an optional array selecting `dedicated`, `public`, or both, with dedicated as the default. It affects only Telegram. Create and update share the same validation and still require one explicit recipient. Public selection verifies against the owner in adapter configuration; dedicated selection verifies pairing records. The same person must satisfy both when both are selected.

Public task notifications are a restricted path separate from ordinary public session reports. They do not relax `sourceSessionId`, subscription or Telegram-only requirements on `/api/notifications/send` or `LocalMessageSend`. Only `CronScheduler.finalizeTaskRun` supplies the internal `getTaskNotificationContext` closure, pinned to the original task/run. Each call re-reads the registered task in `scheduled_tasks.json` and the terminal run in the current `scheduled_tasks_log.json`, rather than using a derived SQLite view or caller-supplied body. The task must remain registered with enabled public notification settings. A one-shot task's automatic disablement is not deletion and does not invalidate its completed run.

Before the first send and every retry, `notificationService.ts` re-checks this context, the explicit recipient against the current owner, public enablement and the realpath of the actual execution directory against allowed project roots. Bot token, owner and generation are pinned to the configuration read at delivery start; changes cause refusal, not redirection. Missing trusted context, deleted tasks, forged runs and tampered recipients fail visibly. This branch reuses HTTP transport without requiring the public polling process online and creates no subscription, session-reply map or approval credential.

Tasks retain `NotificationDeliveryStore` pending/settle, confirmed/failed/indeterminate and restart-recovery semantics instead of the session-report outbox. The public idempotency key only appends `::public`; dedicated legacy keys are unchanged. An optional `telegramEntrypoint` distinguishes records. Existing normalization reads legacy records as dedicated without rewriting old task configuration. The two entries settle independently and one failure cannot suppress the other. Telegram 429 honors `retry_after`, 5xx has bounded retries, and each attempt re-authorizes; timeout or uncertain network results are not blindly resent. Headers distinguish subscribed sessions from tasks, tasks identify task/run, and the body retains existing task-summary limits. See [Scheduled tasks](../desktop/schedule.md) for usage.

## Chat WebSocket

Clients connect to:

```text
ws://127.0.0.1:3456/ws/<session-id>
```

Common client messages include:

- `user_message` and `stop_generation`;
- `permission_response` and `computer_use_permission_response`;
- `set_permission_mode` and `set_runtime_config`;
- `sync_state` and `prewarm_session`;
- `ping`.

The server sends connection and session state, text deltas, thinking, tool calls and results, permission requests, retry or fallback state, errors, task or team updates, and `pong`. Use `src/server/ws/events.ts` as the complete field contract.

The Desktop client sends a ping every 30 seconds and reconnects if no pong arrives within 10 seconds. Reconnect delay is capped at 30 seconds; it does not stop permanently after a fixed number of attempts. A custom client should reconnect, resynchronize state, and ignore unknown fields added to future messages.

## Reverse-proxy checklist

For remote use:

1. Enable H5 on the server, generate a separate token, and configure exact allowed origins.
2. Use HTTPS so the token is never sent over a public network in cleartext.
3. Proxy static assets, `/api/*`, `/proxy/*`, and `/ws/*`.
4. Enable WebSocket upgrade for `/ws/*`.
5. Preserve the public Host and standard proxy headers.
6. Do not expose the internal `/sdk/*` path.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Port does not bind | Whether `SERVER_PORT` is occupied and contains a valid number |
| `/health` works but an API returns `403` | The request is classified as remote while H5 is disabled |
| API or WebSocket returns `401` | H5 token is missing or stale, or the WebSocket lacks a query token |
| Browser reports CORS | The page's exact Origin is in the H5 allowed-origin list |
| WebSocket reconnects repeatedly | Proxy upgrade support, token forwarding, and proxy idle timeouts |
| Page returns `404` | `desktop/dist` was not built or `CLAUDE_H5_DIST_DIR` is wrong |
| Remote traffic is treated as local | The proxy removed both the public Host and every proxy-trace header |
