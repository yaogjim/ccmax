# WeChat Integration

For people who only want to use WeChat: the whole setup is one QR scan, with no developer platform to register on. The trade-off is that permission approval is text replies rather than tappable buttons, and only private chats are supported.

Besides text, this path accepts platform-provided voice transcripts, images, and file attachments. WeChat and Enterprise WeChat are separate integrations; this page describes the WeChat tab in Settings.

## Bind the bot account

1. Open **Settings → IM Adapters** and select the **WeChat** tab.
2. Select **Scan to Bind**.
3. Scan the QR code with WeChat and confirm the login on your phone.
4. Wait for the status to read **WeChat is bound**.

Credentials are written to local configuration and the adapter restarts on its own; no separate save is needed. The tab then offers **Rescan** and **Unbind WeChat account**.

Binding the bot account is not the same as allowing every WeChat contact. Who may use it is decided in the next step.

## Authorize a user

1. Back at the top of the page, under **Pairing**, select **Generate Code**.
2. Send the six-character code to the bound bot in WeChat.
3. Once pairing is confirmed, you can send messages directly.

Codes are valid for 60 minutes, work once, and are invalidated when a new one is generated.

Known WeChat user IDs can instead be entered in **Allowed Users**, separated by commas. That suits a fixed allowlist but is less convenient than pairing.

## Projects and sessions

With **Default Project** set, the first accepted message opens a session in that directory. Without it, the bot lists recent projects; reply with a number, project name, or absolute path.

Later messages in the same chat reuse that session, and the mapping survives a Desktop restart. `/new` picks another project; `/clear` empties the context while keeping the project binding.

## Commands

WeChat has no configurable menu, so the chat box is the only entry point. After pairing, the bot suggests `/help`.

- `/help` or `帮助` — show available commands
- `/status` or `状态` — project, branch, model, run state, and task summary
- `/projects` or `项目列表` — list recent projects again
- `/new` or `新会话` — clear the current binding and choose a project
- `/new <number, project name, or absolute path>` — start directly in that project
- `/clear` or `清空` — clear context, keep the project binding
- `/stop` or `停止` — stop the current generation

## Approval and reply behavior

A permission request arrives as text containing a request ID. Reply with one of:

- `/allow <requestId>` — allow once
- `/always <requestId>` — persist the matching approval
- `/deny <requestId>` — deny

Messages are received through long polling and long replies are split into platform-sized messages. A typing indicator is shown while Claude thinks or runs tools. Images enter model input inline; other files are downloaded to a local temporary path. Oversized attachments are reported back in the chat.

## Sending voice, images, and files

- **Voice**: WeChat transcribes voice on its own servers and pushes the text to the bot, so ccmax reads that text (the protocol's `voice_item.text` field). Transcription is done by the WeChat platform and its quality is up to the platform; the field is something the platform *may* provide, and not every voice note is guaranteed to yield complete text. When the platform provides no text, ccmax does not backfill a transcription on your machine (this WeChat path has no local STT), so it cannot understand that voice note.
- **Images**: downloaded, decrypted, and inlined into model input, so the model genuinely "sees" the picture.
- **Files**: stored at a local temporary path and handed to the session; the model receives a path, but it can read the file content with tools — a reference is not "cannot read".

Attachments over the size limit are rejected, and the bot reports it in the chat.

## Unbind

Two levels:

- **Unbind WeChat account** clears the bot credentials and this platform's authorization lists. Binding again means scanning again.
- **Unbind** next to a name under **Paired Users** revokes only that person. They need a fresh pairing code afterwards.

## Development

Packaged Desktop starts the sidecar automatically. Run it by hand only when working from source:

```bash
cd adapters
bun install
bun run wechat
```

Optional overrides:

```bash
export WECHAT_ACCOUNT_ID="..."
export WECHAT_BOT_TOKEN="..."
export WECHAT_BASE_URL="https://ilinkai.weixin.qq.com"
export WECHAT_USER_ID="..."
export ADAPTER_SERVER_URL="ws://127.0.0.1:3456"
```

Normal Desktop use needs none of these; QR binding writes the local configuration.

## Troubleshooting

**Still unauthorized after a successful scan.** That is the expected flow. Scanning only stores bot credentials; the individual user still has to send a pairing code or appear in **Allowed Users**.

**The QR code expired.** Select **Scan to Bind** again. WeChat login QR codes are short-lived.

**The adapter reports a missing WeChat account.** Neither the environment variables nor `wechat.accountId` / `wechat.botToken` in `~/.claude/adapters.json` took effect. Complete QR binding in Settings first.

**No replies.** Confirm Desktop is running, the tab reads **WeChat is bound**, the sender is paired or allowlisted, and `~/.claude/adapters.json` is writable. When running from source, also confirm `ADAPTER_SERVER_URL` points at the running Desktop server.

**Session not restored after a restart.** Verify that `~/.claude/adapter-sessions.json` is writable and that the session still exists in Desktop.

## Source

`index.ts`, `protocol.ts`, and `media.ts` under `adapters/wechat/`, plus `pairing.ts`, `session-store.ts`, `ws-bridge.ts`, and `http-client.ts` under `adapters/common/`.
